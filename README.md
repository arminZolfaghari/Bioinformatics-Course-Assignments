# Bioinformatics Course Coding Assignments

## [HW 1 - Semi-Global Alignment](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari/Bioinformatics-Course-Assignments/tree/main/HW%201%20-%20Semi-Global%20Alignment)
In this assignment, I implemented a ```Semi-Global Alignment``` from scratch. I used ```PAM250 matrix``` for scoring ([PAM250](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/teach/aainfo/pam250.shtml)).
The program takes two protein sequences as input, calculates the alignment score, and generates two modified sequences after alignment.
#### Sample Input:
```
HEAGAWGHE
PAWHEA
```
#### Sample Output:
```
20
HEAGAWGHE-
---PAW-HEA
```
